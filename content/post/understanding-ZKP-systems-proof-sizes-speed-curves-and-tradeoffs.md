## Choosing the Right Zero-Knowledge Proof System: The Real Differences That Matter

Most people talk about ZKPs as if it’s irrelevant which system you choose. It is not - each proof system comes with its own specific tradeoffs: proof sizes, curve choices, budgets, security assumptions and verification costs. If you pick an inadequate one for your case, it might come with a set of burdens you did not count on in the beginning, and it can affect your project in terms of scaling, time budgeting or verification costs.
In this blogpost, we are going to cover the differences between most commonly used Zero Knowledge Proof types regarding their size, implementation complexity, curves, speed and learning curve.
