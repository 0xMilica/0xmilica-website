## a New Chapter for ZK
As blockchain constantly evolves like a living organism, scalability remains one of its biggest hurdles. Cryptographic operations, especially when dealing with **zero-knowledge proofs**, are often the bottleneck. But what if we could accelerate these operations without sacrificing security? Say ‘Hello world!’ to [Binius](https://gitlab.com/IrreducibleOSS/binius) from [Irreducible](https://www.irreducible.com/): a groundbreaking **SNARK** system built to solve this problem by using the power of **binary towers** - a recently developed cryptographic structure that’s paving the way for more efficient, scalable systems.

## Binary Towers, a Game-Changer
Computer systems function within *the field of 2 {0,1}*. Thus, binary systems are a native language for computers. As SNARKs operate on finite fields of prime order, you will find that in most cases that order is of 256 bits. But, can it be done over **the smallest of fields, the binary field**? Binius introduces a new way of handling cryptographic computations through binary towers. <br />
